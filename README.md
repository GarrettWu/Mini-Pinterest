Welcome to the Mini-Pinterest wiki!<br>

This is a Northeastern University CS5610 course group project (2018 Spring sememster). Our idea is about building a mini "Pinterest" web application with Pinterest-like basic functions and image recommendation system in the backend.

#### Group Members:
* Jiqi Yang
* Fan Wang
* Guanglei Wu

In addition to those basic functions of user login/register/profiles, we want to implement an image waterfall as our website's main page. The waterfall never terminates and the images in the waterfall are displayed according to our users' interest. Users are provided with the tool of "Pin it" to save the image whatever he or she likes in the exploration page to build his or her own profile.<br>

We are currently considering crawling images from Pinterest API.
