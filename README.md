 ### Mini-Pinterest Project Description
  “When it comes to a great idea, you know it when you see it.” <br>
  We are big fans of Pinterest. Here in the Web Development course, we would like to implement a mini website like Pinterest using MEAN Stack. We want young people who love pictures to use our website to connect themselves with the fancy world!<br>
